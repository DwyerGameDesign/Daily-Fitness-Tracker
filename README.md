# ðŸŽ® FitnessTracker

A gamified daily fitness tracker that makes working out fun and engaging!

## ðŸš¨ Running the Application

This app uses ES6 modules and needs to be served from a local server to avoid CORS issues. **You cannot simply open `index.html` directly in your browser.**

### Option 1: Python Server (Recommended)
If you have Python installed:

**Windows:**
```bash
# Double-click start_server.bat
# OR run in Command Prompt/PowerShell:
python server.py
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
python3 server.py
```

### Option 2: Node.js Server
If you have Node.js installed:

```bash
npm start
# OR
npx serve . -p 8000
```

### Option 3: Other HTTP Servers
Any local HTTP server will work:

```bash
# PHP (if installed)
php -S localhost:8000

# Live Server (VS Code extension)
# Right-click index.html â†’ "Open with Live Server"
```
